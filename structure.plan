Some additional notes:
  * Need to be able to go human for NPC invasions
  * Don't engage in online-play functionality outside of messages
  * Should "Kiln Glitch" like skips (wrong warps) be allowed? Would be interesting in scenarios 
    like "Obtain BKH in Kiln of First Flame", if we were to add something like that.
  * How should allowing duping be viewed on all skill levels (casual, speedrunner, masochist)?
    Should we have cards to obtain <n> of souls?
  * Forcing weapon types or specific weapons for certain areas or enemies?
